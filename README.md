# ColorPaint Global Supply Chain Expansion Project

**Role:** Supply Chain Manager (Team Leader)

## Project Overview

I led a dynamic, 5-person, multi-disciplinary team to transform ColorPaint’s supply chain and fuel its global expansion. Our mission was to create a 3-year strategy to optimize operations and open new markets by establishing a cutting-edge warehouse in Port Said, Egypt. This strategic move leverages Port Said’s prime location along the Suez Canal to serve Europe, Africa, and the Middle East.
